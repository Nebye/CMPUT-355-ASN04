# CMPUT-355-ASN04
Assignment 04 for CMPUT 355

## Idea 02
### Connect6 Vizualizer
#### Special thanks to [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) which I used to make the exe version of the game.

User Requirements:
* Python Environment (only tested for python3)

To Run:
1. You can either run the "connect6.exe" file found in the CMPUT-355-ASN04-CONNECT6\dist\connect6 directory
2. Or, open a terminal in the root folder of the repository and type in the command:"python connect6.py"
