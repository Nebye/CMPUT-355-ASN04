Assignment 04 for CMPUT 355

~~## Idea 01~~
~~### Othello Bot
#### First Move
- If bot goes first pick a random tile to start
~~- If opponent goes first then start implementing MCTS
#### 2nd Move+
- Use MCTS to search a few moves ahead (start with 2 when first making this then gradually push the bot until things get buggy) and go towards
~~the path that is most unsuccessfull for the opponent (at which path the opponent has the least amount of tiles on the board).
- Goal of the bot leans more towards making the opponent unsuccessfull rather than win the game

~~#### MCTS stuff
	- If end of path is null (game does not go that far using those potential moves, go one branch back up till it is not null)
	
## Idea 02

### If I run out of time to implement Othello Bot swap to this
